Design of a Single Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com
Imagine a user wants to access the website located at www.foobar.com. Here is how the infrastructure is set up to handle the request:

Step 1: User's Request
The user opens a web browser and types in www.foobar.com.
The browser needs to resolve this domain name into an IP address to locate the server hosting the website. This process is handled by the DNS (Domain Name System).
Step 2: DNS Resolution
The domain name foobar.com is configured with an A DNS record for www that points to the IP address 8.8.8.8.
The DNS server provides the IP address 8.8.8.8 to the user's browser.
Step 3: Communication Between the User's Computer and the Server
The browser uses the IP address 8.8.8.8 to send an HTTP (or HTTPS) request to the server.
This request is routed over the internet using the TCP/IP protocol suite, which is the fundamental protocol for all internet communications.
Step 4: Server Setup
Server (Located in a Data Center): The server, with IP address 8.8.8.8, is located in a data center, a secure environment with reliable power, cooling, and network connectivity.
Web Server (Nginx): Inside the server, there is a web server component, represented by a small box labeled "Web Server (Nginx)." This web server handles incoming HTTP requests and serves static content (like images, CSS, JavaScript), or acts as a reverse proxy to the application server for dynamic content.
Application Server: Another small box labeled "Application Server" represents the server that runs the backend code to handle dynamic content.
Code Base (Application Files): A small box labeled "Code Base" or "Application Files" represents the website's files, scripts, and resources used by the application server.
Database (MySQL): Another small box labeled "Database (MySQL)" represents the database management system used to store all the application's necessary data.
Step 5: Request Handling
Web Server (Nginx):
Nginx receives the request for www.foobar.com.
For static content (like images or HTML files), Nginx serves it directly to the user's browser.
For dynamic content (like user login or database queries), Nginx forwards the request to the application server.
Application Server:
The application server processes the request (e.g., retrieves data from the MySQL database, performs computations, etc.).
It returns the processed data to Nginx, which then sends the response back to the user's browser.
Step 6: Response to User
The user's browser receives the response and displays the content of www.foobar.com.
Explanation of Components
Server:

Server Drawn on the Diagram: The server is the main rectangular box on the diagram.
Located in a Data Center: The server is physically located in a data center, which provides the necessary infrastructure (power, cooling, network) to keep the server running securely and efficiently.
Physical or Virtual Server: The server can be a physical machine (hardware server) or a virtual machine (VM) running on shared physical hardware.
Runs an Operating System (OS): The server runs an OS like Linux (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) that manages hardware resources and provides a platform for running web services.
Web Server (Nginx):

Web Server Drawn on the Diagram: The web server (Nginx) is represented by a small box inside the server.
Role of the Web Server: The web server's role is to handle incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests, serve static content (like HTML, CSS, images), and forward requests for dynamic content to the application server.
Application Server:

Application Server Drawn on the Diagram: The application server is represented by another small box inside the server.
Role of the Application Server: The application server processes dynamic content. It runs the backend logic, handles user requests, and interacts with the database to fetch or store data.
Code Base (Application Files):

Code Base Drawn on the Diagram: The code base is represented by a small box labeled "Code Base" or "Application Files" inside the server.
Application Files Drawn on the Diagram: This represents the actual code files that make up the website's logic and frontend.
Database (MySQL):

Database Drawn on the Diagram: The database is represented by a small box labeled "Database (MySQL)" inside the server.
Role of the Database: The database stores all application data, such as user information, content, and other structured data. The application server queries the database to retrieve or update data as needed.
DNS (Domain Name System):

DNS's Role: The DNS translates the domain name www.foobar.com into the server's IP address 8.8.8.8. When a user types the URL, the DNS system translates it into the server's IP address so the user's browser can locate it.
www.foobar.com is an A Record: The "A" record is a DNS record type that maps a domain name to an IP address. www.foobar.com is an A record pointing to IP 8.8.8.8.
Communication Over Network:

Server Communicating Over TCP/IP: The server communicates with the user's computer over a network using the TCP/IP protocol suite, specifically HTTP/HTTPS protocols for web traffic.
Issues with This Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Since all components (web server, application server, code base, database) are on a single server, any failure (hardware failure, power outage, etc.) will bring down the entire website.
Downtime During Maintenance: When deploying new code or restarting services (like Nginx), the server will experience downtime, making the website temporarily unavailable.
Cannot Scale: A single server has limited resources (CPU, RAM, disk space). If traffic increases beyond the server's capacity, the website may become slow or completely unresponsive.
